# hand-mouse
The Hand Mouse project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system developed using the OpenCV library in Python. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the camera feed and detect hand gestures. When a specified gesture is made, the system performs actions such as moving the mouse cursor and clicking.

# how to use 

clone this repo

Make sure you have Python installed, then using terminal/cmd navigate to the cloned folder and run the below command

    pip install -r requirements.txt


*NOTE: It is recommended to use VS Code and launch it from there, if you don't like VS Code for some weird reason then you can use cmd/terminal too 

Now to start the program run the below command

    python ./handMouse.py

There are 2 modes, Moving mode, and Clicking mode

# 1. Moving mode
Raise your right hand and moving mode will be activated. Use the "☝🏻" gesture to move the mouse across the screen

# 2. Clicking Mode
Use the gesture "✌🏻" to activate clicking mode. When clicking mode is activated, cursor will stop moving, and when you cross your index finger with your ring finger
"🤞🏻" click action will be performed.
